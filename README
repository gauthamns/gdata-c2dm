This gem is for sending C2DM message to an android device. It depends on gdata gem
provided by Google.

How to use?

c2dm_sender = GData::Client::C2dm.new()

Get Google AuthLogin token:
auth_token = c2dm_sender.clientlogin(username, password, nil, nil, 'ac2dm')

Auth token should be stored by the application.

To send the c2dmessage:
c2dm_sender.set_clientlogin_token(auth_token)
c2dm_sender.send_c2dmessage(registration_id, collapse_key, delay_while_idle, data_hash)

data_hash format:
data_hash = Hash.new
data_hash['body'] = body
data_hash['mykey'] = my_value

FAQ:

1. Will it automatically obtain AuthToken and send C2DMessage?
No. We have to manually obtain the AuthToken by clientlogin function and store it
with us. We will have to supply it to send the c2dmessage.
The reason for this is that we need not fetch AuthToken everytime we send C2dmessage.
Once obtained, we should use the same till it expires.

2. AutoRenewal of AuthToken. Will it automatically fetch the new AuthToken if expired?
Currently not supported. Will have to find a way to do it.

3. Bulk message delivery?
No. We have to send one C2DMessage at a time. In the pipeline.

This gem is still a work in progress. Will be adding lot many things as and when
need arises. You are free to adapt and contribute.

Thanks.
